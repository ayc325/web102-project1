## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I had included getting the grid to show up properly. Originally, all my cards just stacked on top of each other. I fixed this by adding a `<td></td>` tag surrounding each Card component.

## Running the app

* npm install
* npm run dev
